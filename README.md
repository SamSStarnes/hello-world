# hello-world

I am currently a second-year student at the University of Iowa studying **Business Analatyics and Information Systems in the Tippie College of Business, as well as pursuing an SRM minor through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences**. I have always been intrigued by numbers and statistics because of my upbringing in sports so i would like to do something that pairs the both of these interests together as that is where my strongest passions lie but I know how competitive that market is so I cannot be certain I will be able to secure a spot within this industry. **I have a younger brother who is currently 17 and a junior in high school in Marion, Iowa (Go Lions) and a dog named _Kaner who is a 5-year old goolden doodle_ whom I love dearly.** His name was chosen after a lenghty dicussion between my family and came to the conclusion to name him after Patrick Kane, the ~~second~~ greatest American-born hockey player to play the game ~~behind Auston Matthews~~.
